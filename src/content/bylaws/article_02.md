## Section 1. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

The Foundation shall operate primarily as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (`DAO`), leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts for governance and operations.

## Section 2. Token-Based Governance

1. Governance rights shall be extended to holders of Huly tokens (`eHULY` and `nHULY`).
1. Token holders shall have voting power proportional to their token holdings.
1. Both `eHULY` and `nHULY` tokens shall carry equal voting rights.

## Section 3. DAO Structure

The `DAO` shall consist of the following components:
1. __Token Holders:__ All individuals or entities holding Huly tokens.
1. __Smart Contracts:__ Autonomous code executing governance decisions and managing Foundation resources.
1. __Proposal System:__ A mechanism for submitting, discussing, and voting on governance proposals.
1. __Treasury:__ A multi-signature wallet or smart contract managing the Foundation's assets.

## Section 4. Human Roles

While the Foundation operates primarily as a `DAO`, certain human roles may be established to facilitate operations:
1. __Secretary:__ A human appointee responsible for:
    1. Executing `DAO` decisions that require off-chain actions.
    1. Interfacing between the `DAO` and external entities.
    1. Preparing and publishing regular reports on Foundation activities.
    1. Managing day-to-day administrative tasks.
1. __Technical Maintainers:__ Individuals or teams responsible for maintaining and upgrading the Foundation's technical infrastructure, subject to `DAO` approval.

## Section 5. Working Groups

1. The `DAO` may establish specialized working groups to focus on specific areas such as technical development, marketing, community engagement, or legal compliance.
1. Working groups shall be formed and dissolved through `DAO` voting processes.
1. Participation in working groups shall be open to all token holders, subject to DAO-approved selection criteria.

## Section 6. Decision-Making Process

1. __Proposals:__ Any token holder may submit proposals for consideration by the `DAO`.
1. __Discussion Period:__ Each proposal shall have a designated discussion period for community feedback and refinement.
1. __Voting:__ After the discussion period, proposals shall be put to a vote among token holders.
1. __Execution:__ Approved proposals shall be executed automatically through smart contracts where possible, or by the Secretary for off-chain actions.

## Section 7. Checks and Balances

1. __Multi-Signature Requirement:__ Any transaction involving more than 1% of the Foundation's treasury shall require approval from multiple designated signers, as determined by the `DAO`.
1. __Timelock Mechanism:__ Major changes to the Foundation's structure or operations shall be subject to a timelock period, allowing for community review and potential veto before implementation.
1. __Transparency:__ All Foundation activities, including financial transactions and voting results, shall be recorded on-chain and publicly accessible.

## Section 8. Amendments to Governance

Any changes to this governance structure shall require a supermajority vote (two-thirds) of participating tokens, with a minimum quorum of 10% of all circulating tokens.
