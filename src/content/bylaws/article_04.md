## Section 1. Token Types and Total Supply

The Huly ecosystem shall consist of two interchangeable token types:

1. __eHULY:__ Ethereum-based tokens
1. __nHULY:__ Native tokens on the Huly blockchain

The total supply of Huly tokens shall be capped at __120 million__. Under no circumstances will the total supply exceed this cap. The tokens will be distributed as follows:

1. __54 million__ `eHULY` tokens for free market distribution and staking rewards
1. __72 million__ `nHULY` tokens to be mined over time
1. __6 million__ tokens to be burned by the Foundation

Additionally, **72 million** `eHULY` tokens and **54 million** `nHULY` tokens will be locked on their corresponding networks for `eHULY` ↔ `nHULY` bridging operations. This locking mechanism ensures that the interchangeability between `eHULY` and `nHULY` is maintained at a 1:1 ratio at all times, preventing any disbalance in the token ecosystem.

## Section 2. eHULY Token Distribution

The __126 million__ `eHULY` tokens shall be allocated as follows:

1. __Free Market Distribution:__ 24 million tokens
    1. Huly Foundation is obligated to distribute these tokens to the free market through decentralized exchanges (e.g., `Uniswap`) according to the following schedule:
        1. 240,000 eHULY tokens will be released weekly for 100 weeks, starting January 3, 2025.
    1. Assets received by Huly Foundation from this distribution will remain in the free market, providing liquidity for Huly token traders.
    1. While the Foundation will act as an initial liquidity provider to ensure market stability and accessibility, it will actively encourage and support the participation of other liquidity providers to foster a diversified and decentralized market.

1. __Staking Rewards:__ 30 million tokens
    1. Distributed to token holders participating in the staking program. The distribution schedule is as follows:
        1. Weeks 1-150: 12 million tokens (80,000 per week)
        1. Weeks 151-300: 9 million tokens (60,000 per week)
        1. Weeks 301-450: 6 million tokens (40,000 per week)
        1. Weeks 451-600: 3 million tokens (20,000 per week)
    1. The staking program will commence on January 10, 2025.
    1. The Huly Foundation will hold these 30 million tokens initially and will participate in the staking pool to support its operations.
    1. Tokens held by the Foundation for staking rewards are exclusively for distribution to participants according to the staking schedule and cannot be sold or transferred directly to the market.

1. __Bridging Pool:__ 72 million tokens locked in smart contracts to facilitate 1:1 exchanges between `eHULY` and `nHULY`. This pool ensures that the interchangeability between `eHULY` and `nHULY` tokens is maintained at all times, supporting the stability and balance of the Huly token ecosystem.

## Section 3. nHULY Token Distribution

The __126 million__ `nHULY` tokens will be created as follows:

1. __Mining Rewards:__ 72 million tokens
    1. Distributed to miners over time through Proof of Work consensus.
    1. The network will adjust difficulty to ensure that the equivalent of 24 million `nHULY` tokens will be mined during the first 100 weeks of Huly Blockchain operations, then halved every 200 weeks. Thus, a total of 72 million nHULY tokens will be produced.
    1. `nHULY` mining will commence 100 weeks after the start of the `eHULY` distribution program (January 3, 2025).

2. __Bridging Pool:__ 54 million tokens. These tokens will be created with the Genesis block and used for `eHULY` ↔ `nHULY` bridging to support the 1:1 interchangeability mechanism.

## Section 4. Staking Program and Foundation Participation

1. __30 million__ `eHULY` tokens shall be allocated for the staking rewards program.
1. The distribution schedule for staking rewards is detailed in [Section 2](#section-2-ehuly-token-distribution) of this Article.
1. Staking rewards distribution will commence on __January 10, 2025__.
1. The Foundation will participate as the initial staker, staking the entire __30 million__ token allocation. This serves several critical purposes:
    1. To provide operational funding for the Foundation through earned staking rewards.
    1. To prevent market manipulation by ensuring the staking pool is not initially empty, which could otherwise allow participants to cheaply acquire a disproportionate share of rewards.
1. By staking the full allocation initially, the Foundation creates a fair and competitive environment for all participants from the outset, requiring significant investment to obtain a large position in the staking pool.
1. The Foundation's participation in staking is subject to the following conditions:
    1. The Foundation will be subject to the same rules and reward rates as all other participants.
    1. These tokens cannot be used for market trading or direct transfer by the Foundation.
    1. As staking rewards are distributed to participants, the Foundation's stake will gradually decrease.
1. This mechanism incentivizes the Foundation to maintain its stake as long as possible while ensuring that the allocated tokens are used solely for participant rewards over the duration of the staking program.

## Section 5. Token Burning

1. The Foundation shall burn a total of __6 million__ tokens over __600 weeks__.
1. __10,000 tokens__ will be burned __every week__, starting from __January 10, 2025__.
1. The burning process will be executed through a publicly verifiable smart contract.
1. The purpose of token burning is twofold:
    1. To reduce the Foundation's stake in the Huly ecosystem to a target of __3.95%__ of the total supply (excluding the Foundation's expenditures). The actual stake will depend on market activity, especially within the staking program, and the Huly Foundation's spending.
    1. For detailed calculations supporting 3.95% target percentage, please refer to Appendix A. Note that the theoretical maximum stake of the Foundation is __20%__; reaching this level would indicate the failure of the [Huly Project](https://huly.io).
    1. To gradually distribute tokens over time, thereby minimizing the risk of sudden supply shocks and price volatility.

## Section 6. Market Capitalization and Liquidity

1. The Foundation shall use crypto assets received from the free market distribution to provide initial liquidity on decentralized exchanges.
1. The Foundation shall not act as a central market maker or attempt to manipulate token prices.

## Section 7. Bridging Mechanism

1. A 1:1 bridging mechanism between `eHULY` and `nHULY` shall be maintained to ensure price parity.
1. The bridging process will be facilitated through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and will be natively supported by Huly blockchain.
1. __54 million__ `nHULY` tokens will be locked at the Huly Blockchain launch within the Genesis block to support the bridging mechanism.

## Section 8. Mining of nHULY

1. `nHULY` mining shall commence 100 weeks after the start of `eHULY` distribution.
1. Mining difficulty will be adjusted to ensure that __24 million__ nHULY tokens are mined during the first __100 weeks__.
1. Mining rewards will be halved every __200 weeks__ thereafter, with a total of __72 million__ nHULY tokens produced.

## Section 9. Transparency and Reporting

1. The Foundation shall provide real-time, on-chain data on token distribution, staking, and burning.
1. Quarterly reports on token economics, including distribution progress, staking participation, and mining statistics, shall be published by the Foundation.

## Section 10. Modifications to Token Economics

1. Any proposed changes to the token distribution model or economic parameters must be approved through the `DAO` voting process as outlined in [Article III](/bylaws/article_03).
1. Such proposals shall be classified as __Major Proposals__, requiring a __2/3 majority__ to pass.

## Section 11. Total Supply Cap

The total supply of Huly tokens _shall never exceed 120 million_. This cap is absolute and ensures the long-term stability and predictability of the Huly token market. Under no circumstances will additional tokens be minted beyond this cap.
