## 1. Purpose

This article outlines the principles, processes, and governance mechanisms for the technical development and maintenance of the Huly blockchain and associated technologies.

## 2. Core Principles

The technical development of the Huly blockchain shall adhere to the following principles:

1. __Decentralization:__ Maintaining and enhancing the decentralized nature of the network
1. __Security:__ Prioritizing the security and integrity of the blockchain
1. __Scalability:__ Improving the scalability and performance of the network
1. __Interoperability:__ Enhancing compatibility with other blockchain networks and protocols
1. __Innovation:__ Fostering continuous innovation in blockchain technology
1. __Accessibility:__ Ensuring the technology remains accessible to a wide range of users and developers

## 3. Technical Roadmap

1. The Foundation shall maintain a public technical roadmap outlining planned developments and improvements.
1. The roadmap shall be reviewed and updated quarterly, subject to `DAO` approval.

## 4. Development Process

1. All core protocol development shall follow an open-source model.
1. Code repositories shall be publicly accessible and open for community contributions.
1. A formal code review process shall be established for all proposed changes.

## 5. Governance of Technical Changes

1. Minor Updates:
    1. Bug fixes and minor improvements may be implemented by the core development team.
    1. These changes must be publicly announced and documented.
1. Major Updates:
    1. Significant protocol changes or new features must be proposed as Huly Improvement Proposals (HIPs).
    1. HIPs shall undergo community discussion and DAO voting before implementation.

## 6. Huly Improvement Proposals (HIPs)

1. Any community member may submit a HIP.
1. HIPs must include:
    1. Detailed technical specifications
    1. Rationale for the proposed change
    1. Implementation plan
    1. Potential risks and mitigation strategies
1. HIPs shall follow a standardized format and numbering system.

## 7. Voting on HIPs

1. HIPs require a 67% majority of votes cast to pass.
1. A minimum quorum of 20% of all circulating tokens is required for HIP votes.
1. The voting period for HIPs shall be 14 days.

## 8. Implementation of Approved HIPs

1. Upon approval, the core development team shall integrate the `HIP` into the development roadmap.
1. Regular updates on the progress of `HIP` implementation shall be provided to the community.

## 9. Emergency Patches

1. In cases of critical vulnerabilities, the core development team may implement emergency patches.
1. Such actions must be immediately disclosed to the community and ratified by a `DAO` vote within 72 hours.

## 10. Forks and Chain Splits

1. Any proposed hard fork must be approved by a __75%__ supermajority `DAO` vote.
1. In the event of a chain split, the Foundation shall support the chain chosen by the `DAO`.

## 11. Blockchain Parameters

1. Key blockchain parameters (e.g., block size, gas limits) shall be adjustable through `DAO` voting.
1. Parameter change proposals must include thorough analysis of potential impacts.

## 12. Smart Contract Upgrades

1. Core smart contracts may be upgraded through a time-locked, multi-signature process.
1. Upgrade proposals must be publicly announced and subject to community review.

## 13. External Audits and Security

1. Regular third-party security audits of the core protocol and smart contracts shall be conducted.
1. Audit reports shall be made public within 30 days of completion.
1. A bug bounty program shall be maintained to incentivize the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## 14. Developer Ecosystem

1. The Foundation shall provide resources and support to foster a vibrant developer ecosystem.
1. Regular hackathons, grants, and educational programs shall be organized to encourage development on the Huly blockchain.

## 15. Interoperability and Standards

1. The Foundation shall actively participate in industry-wide standardization efforts.
1. Development of cross-chain interoperability solutions shall be prioritized.

## 16. Data Privacy and Compliance

1. All technical development shall adhere to best practices in data privacy and security.
1. Compliance with relevant regulations shall be regularly assessed and maintained.

## 17. Technical Documentation

1. Comprehensive and up-to-date technical documentation shall be maintained and made publicly accessible.
1. Documentation shall be available in multiple languages to support the global developer community.

## 18. Resolving Technical Disagreements

In cases of significant disagreements within the developer community on technical decisions, a formal dispute resolution process shall be initiated. This process will involve:
1. A detailed technical review by a panel of experts elected by the `DAO`.
1. A public debate period where arguments for different approaches are presented.
1. A final decision made through a DAO vote, requiring a __2/3__ majority to pass.

## 19. Continuous Improvement

This article and the technical governance processes shall be subject to regular review and improvement through the amendment process outlined in [Article VI](/bylaws/article_06).
