## Section 2. Grounds for Dissolution

The Foundation may be dissolved under the following circumstances:

1. Achievement of all Foundation goals, rendering its continued existence unnecessary.
1. Insurmountable technical, legal, or financial challenges that prevent the Foundation from fulfilling its purpose.
1. A community decision that the Foundation is no longer serving its intended purpose effectively.

## Section 3. Proposal for Dissolution

1. A proposal for dissolution may be submitted by any token holder.
1. The proposal must include:
    1. Detailed rationale for dissolution
    1. Comprehensive plan for winding down Foundation operations
    1. Proposed distribution of remaining assets
    1. Timeline for the dissolution process

## Section 4. Community Review and Discussion

1. Upon submission, the dissolution proposal shall undergo a mandatory 30-day review and discussion period.
1. During this time, the community may suggest modifications or alternatives to dissolution.

## Section 5. Voting on Dissolution

1. Any non-liquid assets (e.g., intellectual property, domains) shall be transferred to the public domain or to a community-nominated successor entity.

## Section 8. Blockchain and Protocol Considerations

1. The dissolution of the Foundation does not inherently mean the end of the Huly blockchain or protocol.
