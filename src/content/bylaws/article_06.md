## Section 1. Purpose of Amendments

The amendment process exists to ensure that the Huly Foundation can adapt its governance structure and operational procedures to meet evolving needs and challenges while maintaining its core principles and community-driven nature.

## Section 2. Proposal of Amendments

1. Any token holder may propose amendments to these bylaws.
1. Amendment proposals must include:
    1. The specific article and section to be amended
    1. The proposed new text
    1. A detailed rationale for the amendment
    1. An analysis of potential impacts on the Foundation and Huly ecosystem

## Section 3. Amendment Categories

Amendments shall be categorized as follows:

1. __Minor Amendments:__ Changes that do not significantly alter the Foundation's structure, purpose, or governance model.
1. __Major Amendments:__ Changes that substantially impact the Foundation's structure, purpose, or governance model.

## Section 4. Review Process

1. All proposed amendments shall undergo a mandatory 14-day review period.
1. During this period, the community may discuss the proposal and suggest modifications.
1. The proposer may refine the amendment based on community feedback.

## Section 5. Voting on Amendments

1. Minor Amendments:
    1. Require a 60% majority of votes cast to pass
    1. Minimum quorum of 15% of all circulating tokens
    1. Voting period of 7 days
1. Major Amendments:
    1. Require a 75% supermajority of votes cast to pass
    1. Minimum quorum of 25% of all circulating tokens
    1. Voting period of 14 days

## Section 6. Implementation of Approved Amendments

1. Approved amendments shall be implemented within 30 days of the vote conclusion, unless a different timeline is specified in the amendment proposal.
1. The Secretary shall be responsible for updating the official bylaws document and communicating changes to the community.

## Section 7. Cooling-off Period

1. Failed amendment proposals may not be resubmitted for 90 days, unless significant new information or circumstances arise.
1. The `DAO` may vote to waive this cooling-off period with a __2/3__ majority.
